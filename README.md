# Hey there, I'm Carlos.

Iâ€™m an AI/ML specialist with a passion for innovation in data science, computer vision, and natural language processing.

I currently work as a Senior AI/ML Software Engineer at [USEncryption](https://usencryption.com), where I develop and promote advanced solutions for secure computation on encrypted data, enabling privacy-preserving AI/ML workflows without compromising confidentiality. Alongside my professional role, Iâ€™m also an avid photographer, blending technical expertise with creative expression.

I hold both a Master of Science and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Central Florida. During my time at UCF, I also worked as a research assistant at the Center for Research in Computer Vision (CRCV).

In addition to my technical work, I write about the intersection of AI/ML, data science, software engineering, technology, and photography on my [website](https://csbanon.com), where I share insights on how emerging technologies are shaping both industries.

Here you will find some projects I've been working on throughout the years. You can also find my recent machine learning notebooks in the [Notebooks](https://github.com/csbanon/notebooks) repository.

Thank you for stopping by. If youâ€™d like to work together, or just say hello, feel free to add me on social media. You can also find a bit more about my professional experience on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/csbanon/).
