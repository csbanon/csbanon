# Hey there, I'm Carlos.

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio.

Professionally, Iâ€™m a senior AI/ML engineer and data scientist with a passion for building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.

Iâ€™m particularly drawn to emerging AI technologies and enjoy working on complex problems where data science, natural language processing, and computer vision intersect.

At [USEncryption](https://usencryption.com), I lead the development of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) that enable training and inference on encrypted data. I spearheaded the creation of a Python library that allows data scientists to train machine learning models directly on encrypted data, combining ease of use with advanced cryptographic methods, and deliver solution demos to partners across the healthcare, finance, and government sectors around the world.

I hold both an M.S. and B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Central Florida, where I conducted research in computer vision at the Center for Research in Computer Vision (CRCV).

Alongside my professional role, Iâ€™m also an avid photographer and writer, blending technical expertise with creative expression. You can find my work on my [website](https://csbanon.com), where I share my photography and my experiences, insights, and knowledge across a variety of areas that I find fulfilling.

In this page you will find some projects I've been working on throughout the years. You can also find my recent machine learning notebooks in the [Notebooks](https://github.com/csbanon/notebooks) repository.

Thank you for stopping by. If youâ€™d like to work together, or just say hello, feel free to add me on social media. You can also find a bit more about my professional experience on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/csbanon/).
